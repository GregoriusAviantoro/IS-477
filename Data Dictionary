**Notes**

- All rows correspond to the year 2018 after filtering the Gapminder data.
- `gdp_per_capita_happiness` comes from the World Happiness Report and is on the report's internal index scale, while `gdp_per_capita_gapminder` is an economic GDP per capita measure in constant international dollars.
- `healthy_life_expectancy_whr` is the contribution term used in the World Happiness Report, which is distinct from the raw `life_expectancy` value from Gapminder.
- Countries with missing values in one or more indicators are retained to preserve transparency, as documented in the Data Quality section.
